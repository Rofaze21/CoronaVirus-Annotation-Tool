# CoronaVirus News Annotation Tool

> ## Check out the application [here!](https://video-marking-tool.web.app/#/Atlanta,%20Ga/WAGA/FOX%205%20News%20at%2010/120/This%20is%20an%20example%20of%20the%20text%20we%20would%20show%20the%20coder%20of%20where%20the%20keyword%20hit%20occurred/xWAGA_03_01_1/23564/lbaum@wesleyan.edu)

This project was created for the DeltaLab at Wesleyan University. They wanted a way for their "human coders" to mark terabytes worth of news footage data seamlessly. The app is currently being used by hundreds of Wesleyan students who are collectively contributing to create more accurate training data for Delta Lab Research's Machine Learning Algorithms.


This app is hosted with _Firebase Hosting_ and was created using _Angular_ and _NodeJS_. Additionally, I am using _Videogular2_ to manage the videos and using _Angular Material_ for the UI. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
